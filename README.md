Groceries Exercise

Create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment:

conda create -n groceries-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate groceries-env
From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

python groceries.py
If you see the provided "products" data structure, you're ready to move on to project development. This would be a great time to make any desired modifications to your project's "README.md" file (like adding instructions for how to setup and run the app like you've just done), and then make your first commit, with a message like "Setup the repo".
